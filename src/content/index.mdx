# Introduction

Steam Game Idler (SGI) is a lightweight, user-friendly application designed to help you farm trading cards, unlock achievements, and boost playtime for any game in your Steam library.

This project was born out of frustration with alternatives like SAM and ASF, which often lacked key features, were overly complex to set up, had ugly outdated interfaces, or suffered from bugs and infrequent updates.

SGI combines the best aspects of these tools into a single, modern, free, and easy-to-use application.
