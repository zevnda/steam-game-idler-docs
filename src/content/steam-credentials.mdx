# Steam Credentials

<References>
    SGI requires your Steam community credentials for the that account you plan to farm cards on to see if games in your library have card drops remaining or not.

    <Callout type='error'>
        Do not share these credentials with anyone
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">
        You can skip these steps if you do not plan to use the [Card
        Farming](/feature/card-farming) feature
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">
        You must get your cookies from https://steamcommunity.com/ and not

    </Callout>

    ## Steps

    <Steps>
        ### Log In to the Steam Community Website
        
        Open your browser and log in to https://steamcommunity.com/ with the account you plan to farm trading cards on
        
        ### Find Your Steam Cookies
        
        1. Press `F12` to open the Developer Tools
        2. Navigate to `Application` _(or `Storage`)_
        3. Under `Cookies`, select `https://steamcommunity.com/`
        4. Copy the `value` for both `sessionid` and `steamLoginSecure`
        5. If you have either a `steamParental` or `steamMachineAuth` cookie, you will need to copy its `value` as well
