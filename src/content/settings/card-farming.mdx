# Card Farming

## Settings

<References>
### Card farming list
* **Purpose:** When active, only games you manually add to the `card farming list` will be farmed

### All games with drops

* **Purpose:** All games in your library with one or more card drops remaining
  will be farmed

### Steam credentials

* **Purpose:** SGI requires your Steam community credentials for the account you
  plan to farm cards on to see if games in your library have card drops
  remaining or not. Read [Steam Credentials](/steam-credentials) for more
  information
