# General

### Stealth idle windows
* **Purpose:** Allows users to idle games without visible idle windows on the desktop/taskbar
* **Considerations:**
    * Requires manually ending the `SteamUtility.exe` process for each game in Windows Task Manager
    * Automated idling (`card farming`, `achievement unlocker`, `auto idle`) will still handle process termination
* **Identifying Processes:**
    * Click the dropdown next to the process in Windows Task Manager to identify which process belongs to which game

### Anti-away status
* **Purpose:** Prevents your Steam status from automatically switching to `away` while SGI is running

### Free game notifications
* **Purpose:** Receive native Windows notifications when free Steam games are available to add to your account

### Delete locally stored data on logout
* **Purpose:** Delete local data such as `steam credentials`, `favorites`, `card farming`, and `achievement unlocker` lists, when logging out of SGI using the `logout` button

### Run at startup
* **Purpose:** SGI will be added to your startup programs and will run when Windows starts

### Minimize to tray
* **Purpose:** Allows users to hide SGI while it continues to work in the background by minimizing it to the system tray
* **Considerations:** Exit SGI completely by right-clicking the icon in the system tray and clicking exit

### Steam web API key
* **Purpose:** Allows users to supply their own Steam web API key for fetching user summary and game data
* **Considerations:**
   - Useful if users want to keep their Steam profile and game details set to private, but still use SGI as normal
     - This works only when using an API key that is attached to the account you are logged in to SGI as
     - Some features still won't work if your profile or game details are private, such as;
       - Displaying recently played games
       - Displaying lock/unlock state of achievements
   - API keys are free for all users with a Steam account, you can [get your API key here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
