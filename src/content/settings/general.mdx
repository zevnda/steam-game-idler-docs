# General

## Prevent away status on Steam

- **Purpose:** Prevents your Steam status from automatically switching to `away` while SGI is running

## Get notified about free games

- **Purpose:** Receive native Windows notifications when free Steam games are available to add to your account

## Run at startup

- **Purpose:** SGI will be added to your startup programs and will run when Windows starts

## Theme

- **Purpose:** Choose between light, dark and preset themes for SGI

## Use your own Steam web API key

- **Purpose:** Allows users to supply their own Steam web API key for fetching user summary and game data
- **Considerations:** - Useful if users want to keep their Steam profile and game details set to private, but still use SGI as normal
    - This works only when using an API key that is attached to the account you are logged in to SGI as
    - Some features still won't work if your profile or game details are private, such as;
        - Displaying recently played games
        - Displaying lock/unlock state of achievements
    - API keys are free for all users with a Steam account, you can [get your API key here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
