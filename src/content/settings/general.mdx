# General

## Settings

### Stealth idle windows
* **Purpose:** Allows users to idle games without visible `idle windows` on the desktop/taskbar
* **Considerations:**
    * Requires manually ending the `SteamUtility.exe` process for each game in Windows Task Manager
    * Automated idling ([Card Farming](/features/card-farming), [Achievement Unlocker](/features/achievement-unlocker), [Auto Idler](/features/auto-idler)) will still handle process termination
* **Identifying Processes:**
    * Click the dropdown next to the process in Windows Task Manager to identify which process belongs to which game

### Anti-away status

- **Purpose:** Prevents your Steam status from automatically switching to `away` while SGI is running

### Free game notifications

- **Purpose:** Receive native Windows notifications when free Steam games are available to add to your account

### Delete locally stored data on logout

- **Purpose:** Delete local data such as `steam credentials`, `favorites list`, `card farming list`, and `achievement unlocker list`, when logging out of SGI using the <Icon type='signout' /> button

### Run at startup

- **Purpose:** SGI will be added to your startup programs and will run when Windows starts

### Minimize to tray

- **Purpose:** Allows users to hide SGI while it continues to work in the background by minimizing it to the system tray
- **Considerations:** Exit SGI completely by right-clicking the icon in the system tray and clicking exit

### Steam web API key

- **Purpose:** Allows users to supply their own Steam web API key for fetching user summary and game data
- **Considerations:** - Useful if users want to keep their Steam profile and game details set to private, but still use SGI as normal
    - This works only when using an API key that is attached to the account you are logged in to SGI as
    - Some features still won't work if your profile or game details are private, such as;
        - Displaying recently played games
        - Displaying lock/unlock state of achievements
    - API keys are free for all users with a Steam account, you can [get your API key here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
