# General

## Hide idle windows <span className='italic'>(not recommended)</span>
* **Purpose:** Allows users to idle games without visible `idle windows` on the desktop/taskbar
* **Considerations:**
    * Requires manually ending the `SteamUtility.exe` process for each game in Windows Task Manager
    * Automated idling ([Card Farming](/features/card-farming), [Achievement Unlocker](/features/achievement-unlocker), [Auto Idler](/features/auto-idler)) will still handle process termination
* **Identifying Processes:**
    * Click the dropdown next to the process in Windows Task Manager to identify which process belongs to which game

## Prevent away status on Steam

- **Purpose:** Prevents your Steam status from automatically switching to `away` while SGI is running

## Get notified about free games

- **Purpose:** Receive native Windows notifications when free Steam games are available to add to your account

## Clear custom list when logging out

- **Purpose:** Clears all `custom list` data when logging out of SGI using the <Icon type='signout' /> button

## Run at startup

- **Purpose:** SGI will be added to your startup programs and will run when Windows starts

## Use your own Steam web API key

- **Purpose:** Allows users to supply their own Steam web API key for fetching user summary and game data
- **Considerations:** - Useful if users want to keep their Steam profile and game details set to private, but still use SGI as normal
    - This works only when using an API key that is attached to the account you are logged in to SGI as
    - Some features still won't work if your profile or game details are private, such as;
        - Displaying recently played games
        - Displaying lock/unlock state of achievements
    - API keys are free for all users with a Steam account, you can [get your API key here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
