# Achievement Unlocker

<References>
### Between the hours of
* **Purpose:** Choose a time range for when SGI should unlock achievements. The [Achievement Unlocker](/features/achievement-unlocker) feature will continue to run, but SGI will not unlock achievements outside of that time range. SGI will automatically continue again once inside the selected time range

### Idle games while active
* **Purpose:** While the [Achievement Unlocker](/features/achievement-unlocker) is running, the current game will be idled for the duration of time it takes to unlock all the available achievements, or until it is manually stopped. By default, games are not idled when unlocking achievements

### Skip hidden achievements
* **Purpose:** Achievements that are listed as `hidden` by the game developer will be skipped

### Unlock interval
* **Purpose:** This will determine how often SGI will unlock a new achievement *(in minutes)*. 
* **Considerations:** Each time a new achievement is unlocked, SGI will randomly select a time interval between the two values you set. For example, if you set the slider to `between 60 and 180 minutes`, SGI will start a random countdown timer that lasts between 1 and 3 hours. When the timer reaches `0`, an achievement will be unlocked and a new random countdown timer will begin
