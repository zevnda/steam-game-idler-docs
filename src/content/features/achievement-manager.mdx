## Additional Information

Some game developers set specific flags for their achievements and statistics, such as `Protected`, `IncrementOnly`, and `Hidden`. SGI will display these flags next to the achievement or statistic.
- `Protected` achievements and statistics can only be modified by official game servers
- `IncrementOnly` statistics means the value can only be increased, not decreased *(i.e. 5 -> 6, not 5 -> 4)*
- `Hidden` achievements hide their description making it harder to know how to unlock them
