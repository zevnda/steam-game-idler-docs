<References page='/features/achievement-unlocker'>
    The Achievement Unlocker feature will automatically unlock your game's achievements in a way that looks like they were earned naturally.

    <Callout type="info">
        Configure your settings in [Settings > Achievement
        Unlocker](/settings/achievement-unlocker) first
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">
        You can add multiple games to the achievement unlocker list
    </Callout>

    ## Steps

    <Steps>
        {<h3 />}
        Click <Icon type='game' /> in the `sidebar`

        {<h3 />}
        Hover over the `game card` of the game you wish to unlock achievements for and click <Icon type='dots' />

        {<h3 />}
        Click on the <MockButton type='context-add' content='add to achievement unlocker' /> option to add the game to your `achievement unlocker list`

        {<h3 />}
        Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker' /> at the top of the `games list` to start the feature
    </Steps>

    ## Additional Information

    You can add as many games to your `achievement unlocker list` as you like, but to remain looking legitimate, SGI will only unlock achievements for one game at a time.

    You can run multiple instances of SGI to unlock achievements for multiple games simultaneously. You will need to pick which games to unlock achievements for in each instance.

    Once SGI finishes unlocking all available achievements for a game, it will move on to the next game, until no games are remaining.

    You can view the games that are currently in your `achievement unlocker list` by selecting `achievement unlocker` from the `dropdown sort menu` at the top of the `games list`.
