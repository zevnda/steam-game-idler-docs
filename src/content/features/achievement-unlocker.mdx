## Additional Information

You can add as many games to your `achievement unlocker list` as you like, but to remain looking legitimate, SGI will only unlock achievements for one game at a time.

Once SGI finishes unlocking all available achievements for a game, it will move on to the next game, until no games are remaining.

You can run multiple instances of SGI to unlock achievements for multiple games simultaneously if you wish to do so. You will need to pick which games to unlock achievements for in each instance.

You can view the games that are currently in your `achievement unlocker list` by selecting `achievement unlocker` from the `drop-down sort menu` at the top of the `games list`.
