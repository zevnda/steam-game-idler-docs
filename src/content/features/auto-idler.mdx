# Auto Idler

Games added to the `auto idle list` will be automatically idled when SGI is launched.

This makes for a hassle-free playtime boosting experience when paired with the `run at startup` option in [Settings > General](/settings/general).

<Callout type="info">
    You can idle a maximum of 32 games at once. This is a Steam limitation
</Callout>
