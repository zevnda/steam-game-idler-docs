# Playtime Booster

The Playtime Booster feature allows you to idle one or more games manually to boost their total playtime.

When idling games with Playtime Booster, external `SteamUtility` *(idle)* processes will be opened to interact with the Steam client and imitate game processes. These processes will be closed when the game is no longer being idled.

<Callout type="info">
    You can idle a maximum of 32 games at once. This is a Steam limitation
