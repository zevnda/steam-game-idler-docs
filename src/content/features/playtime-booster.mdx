# Playtime Booster

The Playtime Booster feature allows you to idle one or more games manually to boost their total playtime.

When idling games with Playtime Booster, external idle windows will be opened showing the game's banner image. When you see this window it means that SGI is currently idling that game and will continue to idle it until you manually close the window.

<Callout type="info">
    You can idle a maximum of 32 games at once. This is a Steam limitation
