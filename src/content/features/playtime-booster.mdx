# Playtime Booster

<References>
    The Playtime Booster feature allows you to idle one or more games manually to boost their total playtime.

    When manually idling games, a small external idle window will appear showing the game's banner image. When you see this window it means that SGI is currently idling that game and will continue to idle it until you manually close the window.

    ## Steps

    <Steps>
        {<h3 />}
        Click <Icon type='game' /> in the `sidebar`

        {<h3 />}
        Hover over the `game card` of the game you wish to idle and click <Icon type='play' />
    </Steps>
